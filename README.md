## Chinook Database
Chinook database is an alternative to the Northwind database, being ideal for demos and testing ORM tools targeting single and multiple database servers.

### Data Model
The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.

### Sample Data
Media related data was created using real data from an iTunes Library. Customer and employee information was manually created using fictitious names, addresses that can be located on Google maps, and other well formatted data (phone, fax, email, etc.). Sales information is auto generated using random data for a four year period.
